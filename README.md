# squidBASE

![squidBASE](squidBASE.png)

The squidBASE framework is built to allow web and android app developers to reach a breaching point, the framework allows this by making it similar to how android UI works.

squidBASE is just html in the backend, all squidBASE does is to reduce the amount of code needed to make interfaces using html, the main purpose for squidBASE is to act as a base for developers to create re-usable components that can be implemented easily.

Id like to give special Thanks To Creators of Animate.css

How This Works:

All Your Code Is Placed Within the â€˜app.mjsâ€™ file and is references within index after the â€˜standard_lib.mjsâ€™ file has been loaded.

```jsx
import { loadModule } from './App_Core/standard_lib.mjs';
import {ui} from './Modules/Native Design/main.mjs';
import {$} from './Modules/Translation Manager/main.mjs';

loadModule('Native Design');

function onStart(){
    const lay = ui.addLayout("Linear","FillXY",null,null,'main');
    
    const btn = ui.addButton($('HelloBtn','en'),350,50,null,lay)
    btn.setStyle({
        backgroundColor: '#04AA6D',
        border: 'none',
        borderRadius: '5px',
        color: 'white',
        padding: '15px 32px',
        textAlign: 'center',
        textDecoration: 'none',
        display: 'inline-block',
        fontSize: '16px',
        margin: '4px 2px',
        cursor: 'pointer'
    });
    btn.setOnTouch(()=>{
    alert($('HelloAlert','tn'))})
    ui.render();
}

function appEvent(ev){
    
}

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{
    onStart();
});
```

*//READ DOCUMENTATION ON USING COMPONENTS:*

*//FEEL FREE TO CONTRIBUTE, YOU ARE ADVISED TO FOLLOW HOW
//CODE LOOKS AND FOLLOW BETTER CODING STANDARD.*

*//REMEMBER YOUR CODE MUST DOCUMENT ITSELF.*

**NOTE: PROJECT DISCONTINUED TEMPORARILY**

**WHY: After carefull consideration, it doesnt look like its worth wasting time and resources building a newer js framework when there are better frameworks in the likes of angular and react.**

**Also due to how the code is structured and the general idea the code is like building a 5 star hotel on-top of wooden planks, simply its brittle.**

**A SHIMMER OF LIGHT IN THE DISTANT FUTURE:**

*Although, even if this framework may not get the light of day all is not over the idea remains and hopefully after my strength and Iâ€™ve got more than enough confidence our 5 star hotel will be ready ðŸ« *
